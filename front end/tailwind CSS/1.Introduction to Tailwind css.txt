1. Introduction (what is tailwind css?)

=> Benefits of using tailwind css that we easily style or customize out HTMl elements without leaving HTML file with the help of the classes.

=> Not like Bootstrap(adds a lot of extra code and files to your website, which can affect its performance and loadng speed).

2. Using play cdn.{

  Play CDn is used to test Tailwind in the
  browser without requiring any build steps
  and is not recommended for production.
